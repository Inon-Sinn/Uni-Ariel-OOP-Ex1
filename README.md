# Uni-Ariel-OOP-Ex1

In this Assignment we had to write an offline Elevator Algorithem which gives the user the best way to distribute the elevators given a list of calls.
What is a call? A call is the data of person who called for the elevator, we get the time at which he called the elevator, his positon, destination and the id of Elevator it is allocated to, by default -1 (not a existing elevator).

Our input is json which represented a Building and csv which represented a list of calls. And the output is a csv of the calls with a possible allocation (not -1)

# The Algorithem 

Our algorithem is a Greedy algorithem.

The Algorithem in short:
<o1>
1. We Collect the input in the main and translate it so we can work with it
2. We use a the greedy algrithem
